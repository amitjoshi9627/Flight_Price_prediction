# Flight_Price_prediction

## Information About the Dataset
Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travellers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable.Here I take on the challenge!. Here the Dataset has flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities and we have to predict the prices of Flights with the help of some features.
